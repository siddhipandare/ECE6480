Automatic Cobb's Angle Measurement for Scoliosis Patients


Cobb Angle Estimator Graphical User Interface (CAE-GUI)

CAE-GUI is a toolbox for processing x-ray image of vertebrae and estimating Cobb angles for scoliosis patients to facilitate diagnosis. 

Getting Started

1.	Clone into the directory of your Python IDE. Email the contributors for the weights file.  
2.	Start your Python IDE, open the main.py and now you are ready to start using the CAE-GUI program!
3.	Once the running process of the program has been started, a window will appear on the screen. Instructions will appear on the side bar located on the left side of the window to prompt upload of an x-ray image of the vertebrae. JPG and JPEG images are accepted. 
4.	Within a few seconds after an image is uploaded, three images, including a) the original uploaded image, b) preprocessed image with enhanced vertebrae and c) predicted landmarks and centroids of vertebrae overlaid onto the original image, as well as all three calculated Cobb angles will appear on the window. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: CAE-GUI utilizes python tensorflow module, which may not work on some Apple systems (i.e. MacBook or iMac). Running the program on Windows systems is strongly encouraged.
